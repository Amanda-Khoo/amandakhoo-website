        <p class="lead mb-4">Long-term sensitization requires new protein synthesis and structural changes in connections. Translation from RNA to proteins is important for long-term sensitization. If an animal was given several tail shocks and introduced Anisomycin (Translation blocker) into the nervous system, there will be no long term sensitization cause there is a blocking of translation. If translation is blocked, it will not induce long term changes because there is no new protein synthesis happening. This blocking would also need to be done while serotonin is applied, not before or after. For long-term change to occur, immediate early genes must allow for the transcription of late-response genes. These late-response genes will last longer and will be translocated to different parts of the cell.  Long-term memory also requires structural changes in connections. CREB plays an important role in production of IEGs and late-response genes. CREB helps convert any memory into long term memory. Without CREB, long term changes are prevented. Compared to the control and long-term habituation, long-term sensitization leads to more neural contacts and neurotransmitter release. Sensory and motor neurons also get more arborized and stronger. With long-term habituation, thereâ€™s less synaptic contacts and neurotransmitters than both the control and long-term sensitization.Long-term sensitization requires new protein synthesis and structural changes in connections.
